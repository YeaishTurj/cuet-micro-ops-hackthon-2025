Dear Participants,

This is an important update regarding your VM setup for the Micro-Ops Hackathon Final Round.

To ensure better performance during the competition:

Please do NOT use Ceph SSD for storage.

Instead, use NVMe storage, as it is faster and will provide better I/O performance for your workloads.

For any query contact: Yeasir Arafat (01730042595) through WhatsApp.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

Dear Participants,
We hope you are doing well. This is a follow-up to the VM allocation email shared earlier for the Micro-Ops Hackathon Final Round at CUET CSE FEST 2025.
1. Confirmation of Information
If you notice any incorrect details in the VM information you received—such as credentials or other data—please inform us immediately so we can correct it.
2. Login Assistance

Dear Participants,

We’d like to share a consolidated update regarding the approved technology stack for the Micro-Ops Hackathon Final Round, including guidance from our technical partner bongoDev.

“We strongly encourage all teams to strictly remain within the approved tech stack. You have AI support available, and the tools we've listed are widely adopted across the industry - over 98% usage. In the age of AI-assisted development and given the time constraints, this stack is more than sufficient to build robust, production-grade solutions.”

Approved Tech Stack

Prometheus
Grafana
Kibana
Elasticsearch
Sentry
MinIO (S3 Compatible Object Storage)
Docker
GitHub Actions / Jenkins (CI/CD)
Important Clarification

You may use additional tools to support your workflow.
However, these tools must not be alternatives or replacements for the strictly provided stack above. The approved stack is central to the competition and must remain the foundation of your solution.
This ensures fairness while still giving you flexibility to enhance your solutions. We’re excited to see how you leverage these technologies to build innovative and production-ready systems.

Dear Participants,

Following up on our earlier communication regarding the approved technology stack for the Micro‑Ops Hackathon Final Round, we would like to add an important clarification.

In addition to the previously mentioned tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana, Elasticsearch, Sentry, MinIO, and Docker), the CI/CD stack — GitHub Actions / Jenkins — is only officially approved for use during the competition.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions in action.

Dear Participants,

We are pleased to share the officially approved technology stack for the Micro-Ops Hackathon Final Round at CUET CSE FEST 2025. The following tools and platforms will be available for you to use during the competition:

Approved Tech Stack:

Prometheus
Grafana
Kibana
Elasticsearch
Sentry
MinIO (S3 Compatible Object Storage)
Docker
You are strongly encouraged to familiarize yourselves with these technologies in advance, as they will play a key role in your performance during the hackathon.

To keep the challenge exciting and to truly test your real-world problem-solving abilities, the complete problem context will be revealed only on the event day. This will ensure a fair and performance-driven competition for all teams.

We wish you the very best in your preparation and look forward to witnessing your skills in action.

Dear Participants,

We are pleased to inform you that infrastructure support for the Micro-Ops Hackathon will be provided through our cloud partner InterCloud. Each team will be allocated a dedicated Virtual Machine (VM) for deployment and testing purposes during the final round.

To help you get familiar with the VM access and usage process in advance, we strongly recommend that you carefully follow the instructional video provided at the link below:

Video Tutorial:

This video demonstrates the complete step-by-step procedure for accessing and using the VM effectively. We advise all team members to review this guideline prior to the event to ensure a smooth experience during the hackathon.

Additionally, all participants are requested to bring their valid student ID card on the event day for verification purposes.

Please also remember to bring your own laptop/PC for the onsite round, as no computer will be provided by the organizer.

If you have any questions related to the VM setup, please feel free to contact us.
